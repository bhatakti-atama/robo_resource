Gazebo is a 3D dynamic simulator with the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments. While similar to game engines, Gazebo offers physics simulation at a much higher degree of fidelity, a suite of sensors, and interfaces for both users and programs.

Typical uses of Gazebo include:

testing robotics algorithms,

designing robots,

performing regression testing with realistic scenarios

A few key features of Gazebo include:

multiple physics engines,

a rich library of robot models and environments,

a wide variety of sensors,

convenient programmatic and graphical interfaces

I would reccomend you to get gazebo alongside ROS. Gazebo is bundled with ros full desktop install.
