Ros is one of the best platforms to to program, build and simulate robots onto

will give a better reason in future lol

I would reccomend the following for begginers:
  1. [A gentle introduction to ros](https://www.cse.sc.edu/~jokane/agitr/) great book for beginers if comfortable with c++
  2. [Programming robots with ros](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-robots-with/9781449325480/) great for beginers with python knowledge. Altough I would still recoomend a gentle introduction first. Get a copy either on libgen 
  
Your ros verssion would be based on your ubuntu version:
  1. ubuntu 16.04 - ros kinetic
  2. ubunutu/pop 18.04 - ros melodic
  3. ubuntu/pop 20.04 - ros noetic
  
I would reccomend going for melodic as it is good balance of moderniuty and package support with pop because it takes better advantage of nvidia gpu's. Also I have a prefrance for pop. Ask bhataktti_atama for 18.04 iso
