2.ROS Tutorials from Justin Huang

These video tutorials are very straight forward. The instructor is clearly mentioning about ROS and its concepts

3. Programming for Robotics: ROS Tutorials from ETH Zurich

The whole tutorials are organized in a structured way. The tutorials are a little old, but the ROS concepts are 
the same. I donâ€™t think this course will be apt for absolute beginners, but if you have some understanding of ROS, 
then you can watch these tutorials.
