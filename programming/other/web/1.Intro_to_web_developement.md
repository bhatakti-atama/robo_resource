## 4. What do HTML, CSS and JavaScript do ?
As far we know that to create a webpage/website we need HTML,CSS and JavaScript but what does each of them contributes in creation of a webpage? <br/><br/>
Lets take another EXAMPLE : If we condider **nouns as HTML** in a sentence than **Adjectives will be CSS** and **Verbs will be JavaScript** (JS for short) i.e. in a sentence " A purple car is speeding up.", Car is HTML , Purple color is CSS and Speeding up is JS. <br/><br/>

We need a Text Editor and a Web Borwse to set up a web developement environment in our system.

- **5.1 Text Editors** : A text editor is a type of computer program that edits plain text. Such programs are sometimes known as "notepad". <br/>
