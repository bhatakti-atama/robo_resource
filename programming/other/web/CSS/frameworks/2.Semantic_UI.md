# Semantic UI

**Semantic UI** treats words and classes as exchangeable concepts. Classes use syntax from natural languages like noun/modifier
relationships, word order, and plurality to link concepts intuitively. To know more [chick here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVcKRNkZeAQ).

The benefit of using Sementic UI over Bootstrap is that for a single component we can download file accordingly whereas in case of bootstrap we need to download it 
as whole. To know more [click here](https://developerz.software/2020/03/29/semantic-ui-or-bootstrap-discover-the-pros-and-cons-of-each-framework/) to read.
