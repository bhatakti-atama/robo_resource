# Framework
**Framework** is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, 
thus providing application-specific software. Simply speaking its a collection of code that we generally use in our programme, we use it so that we need not to write
it own our own i.e. its provides some predefined functions for us to use.<br/>

In this Section we are going to learn 3 CSS frameworks. You may learn all them but Bootstrap is most commonly used one.
