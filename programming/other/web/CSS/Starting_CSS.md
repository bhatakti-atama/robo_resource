**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
As discussed earlier it's analogous of adjectives in a sentence thus it defines the design of the structure i.e. how the webpage will look?<br/><br/>
